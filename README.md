An interactive adult entertainment device. It measures a targets distance from the sensor to control connected devices and interact with media.

- Free and open source. I do this because I like it <3

- Onboard TFT screen with customizable UI

- Control any computer UI slider based on the distance of a target from the sensor.

- Control most devices by using apps with sliders like Intiface Central, XToys, etc.

- Usable by any person.  Mount it on things with nano tape.  Point it at a target that moves farther and closer to the sensor.

- Read the [Build Guide](Documents/buildGuide.txt) for a parts list and fully detailed step-by-step instructions.
